    <p>2:45am. He is crying again. I am still awake.</p>

    <p>This part of the night is, at least, familiar to me. I wake up at around this time most nights. Not quite insomnia, just a short liminal window of semi-consciousness splitting each night's sleep in two. Maybe he will inherit this from me as well as The Bit and his toes.</p>

    <p>During this window, he'll occasionally be struck with the echo of half-inspiration. </p>

    <p>He'll learn that Keith Richards wrote the guitar riff to Satisfaction from inside this state where conscious meets unconscious. Thoughts and ideas here will seem half-formed. Incredibly important. But they never seem to make it through to morning. In time he'll learn that they disappear if he gets up.</p>

    <p>Keith Richards recorded the guitar part to himself before he went back to sleep, so eventually, my son might try writing down what makes it through the boundary as notes to himself to try and capture them. </p>

    <p>But they'll end up sounding like comedy pitches from boring ghosts:</p>

        <span class="notes-item">Are Neighbourhood whatsapp groups secret comedy bits?</span>

        <span class="notes-item">He has my toes</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>He might struggle for a long time about whether this is delirium or insight. Maybe one day he'll understand that the song is actually called (I can't get no) Satisfaction. And maybe one day he'll be OK with that.</p>

    <p>I put him back in his cot, he seems to be asleep. Now it's my turn. I Close my eyes. </p>
