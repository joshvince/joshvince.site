  2:45am. He is crying again. I am still awake.
  <br/><br/>
  I apologise to him. There's something in our genes that means we wake up at roughly this time most nights for our whole life. Not quite insomnia, just a short liminal window of semi-consciousness splitting each night's sleep in two.
  <br/><br/>
  During this window, he'll occasionally be struck with the echo of half-inspiration, desperately trying to stay in the window long enough to grasp at whatever insight seems incredibly important.
  <br/><br/>
  He'll learn that Keith Richards wrote the guitar part to Satisfaction from inside this state where conscious meets unconscious. Thoughts and ideas in this space will seem amazing, incredible, powerful and poetic. But in time he'll find they disappear if he gets up, and he won't remember them in the same way in the light of the morning.
  <br/><br/>
  Keith Richards recorded the guitar part to himself before he went back to sleep, so eventually, he'll try writing down what makes it through the boundary as notes to himself to try and capture them.
  <br/><br/>
  But they'll end up sounding like comedy pitches from boring ghosts:
  <br/><br/>
  <ul>
    <li> Angry Birds but the birds are ancient Atlantis settlers finding new homes </li>
    <li> Neighbourhood whatsapp group admin but funny </li>
    <li> Squashing my beefs using ChatGPT </li>
    <li> Buy boxes from China and make them Marie Kondo boxes </li>
    <li> He has my toes </li>
  </ul>
  <br/><br/>
  Maybe one day he'll understand that the song is actually called (I can't get no) Satisfaction. Maybe one day he'll be OK with that.
  <br/><br/>
  I put him back to sleep. Close my eyes. Trace the shapes in my eyelids.
