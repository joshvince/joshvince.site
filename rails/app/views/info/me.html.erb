        I live on the south coast of the UK and work as a software engineer at
        <%= underlined_external_link "Carwow", %"https://carwow.co.uk" %>.
        I make things like software, music, films and food. I've done this with varying degrees of success (RIP

        I've been a Product person at early stage businesses for about seven years, either
        as an engineer or a Product Manager. I've helped to grow two businesses from seed stage
        to Series A or B, and now I'm working at Carwow and really enjoying solving interesting
        problems every day surrounded by a fantastic team.

        Before Carwow, I worked at TRX, a marketplace helping TV channels connect with
        rights holders to license content around the world. Then, I helped to grow the Product team
        at <%= underlined_external_link "Zencargo", "https://zencargo.com" %> from 4 to 50 people.
        I loved working on hard problems in the Supply Chain, especially as the world fell apart during
        my time there which made what we were doing very relevant.

        Before I moved into product development I worked in the TV industry working with scriptwriters and,
        weirdly, on a spin-off of Eastenders. I directed a play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and somehow
        I've got a surreal <%= underlined_external_link "IMDb", "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4531408/" %> page
        that shows the lengths my friends and I would go to to avoid doing real work.

      <h2 class="font-black text-5xl text-left text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-8">Music.</h2>
      <p>
        As a teenager, I played in a bunch of (criminally unsuccessful) bands and we were pretty sure there was
        an A&amp;R man at a gig we played above a bar once. It was easy to tell because there were only 6 people there
        and we didn't recognise one of them. Nowadays, I play music just for myself. The world is largely unconcerned by
        this development.

        You've made it this far, so lets talk about the important stuff: I am passionate about history, especially
        Republican Rome. I also love football and have a season ticket at Brighton. As you might expect, these two
        interests rarely intersect. If they do for you too, let's chat.
