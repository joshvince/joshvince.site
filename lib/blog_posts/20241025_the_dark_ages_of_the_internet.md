Recently I've noticed an idea start to take root. I keep seeing it everywhere, and I think you probably feel it too. The idea goes like this: the internet is dying. It began collapsing in on itself and things are getting worse. It is being 'enshittified'. The magic has gone out, so they say, of many of the places on the internet and especially the social ones, places where a whole generation - my generation - grew up online.

Lots of people are grieving the death of the Web 2.0: Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Google. These places ain't what they used to be and they're now full of ads, bots, grifters and bullshit. They're dying or dead. Shops, magazines and newspapers are actually closing down without much comment, but people seem incredibly upset by the perceived death of these social places.

Maybe dying is the wrong analogy. There's this fallacy that growth is everything. Growth, mergers and acquisitions, so the thinking goes, are the natural end state of things. Maybe true for finance, for businesses, but not for people. No, for communities the opposite is true: things fall apart all the time.

Recorded history is one big cycle of empires rising and falling, leaving behind a vacuum. But it is often a very long time before something fills these spaces. The time in European history after the Romans retreated from their provinces, leaving behind an apparent tide mark of Civilisation, used to be known as the "dark ages." That name is not in vogue any more. It turns out they weren't so dark after all.

After the Romans left the drizzly island my ancestors called home and the machinery of their state slowly and then suddenly collapsed, generations of people spent their entire lives in the shadows of the crumbling aqueducts left behind with nobody to maintain them. Eventually they became part of the landscape - half-remembered memories of a former way of life. Perhaps some people looked up at them and complained that things ain't what they used to be, but I'm sure most simply went on with their lives.

These Web 2.0 sites like Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and Reddit are undoubtedly shittier than they used to be. It's clear that we are approaching, or are already at, the end of something. But at the same time, that must mean we're at the beginning of something else.

We can look up at those crumbling online aqueducts, grumbling about our lot and the fact that they barely work any more. But, at the risk of stretching the metaphor, I'm here to tell you: before the Empire built the aqueducts to bring us water, we already had wells to do that. The aqueducts came at a price.

## The imperial phase of social media

Web 2.0 started around the turn of the century, after the initial boom and bust of the dotcom era internet. What came next was an historic period of growth and innovation in the web. One of the defining features of this period is the idea of "social media" sites.

Social media businesses fostered and perfected a bunch of incredibly unintuitive 'social' software features for humans. Take one-to-many communication, which was previously reserved for speeches and performances. In these spaces, it became normal for your social interactions to be broadcast to everybody and so everything became a performance. What's more, 'everybody' stopped meaning everyone you knew and started to actually mean everyone. This sheer scale led to anonymity which meant you could behave almost entirely without consequence. And, because you started to see everyone's social interactions, you were able to constantly compare your own life with these curated feeds.

Behaviours like this are either very difficult, heavily stigmatised or nonexistent in the real world. But then the internet became the real world some time around 2012.

These businesses also developed and rode the wave of some seemingly unintuitive business practises: the products were apparently completely free to use forever and companies that lost money in droves seemed to grow aggressively in value.

They might seem unintuitive but of course they make complete sense if you consider the entities backing these businesses. It's important to remember that nearly every technology firm of a certain size is brought into the world by the supposed benevolence of professional gamblers (venture capitalists) who are happy to lose 9 in every 10 bets as long as one pays off handsomely.

In the Web 2.0 era, building an emotional crutch became an effective product strategy: create a community your users feel they belong to, or make it easy to feel clever about themselves by arguing anonymously, or inadequate about themselves by moping in the glow of seemingly perfect curated lives.

Because their strong incentive was to optimise for network effects - a service that is more valuable the more people who use it - they had to figure out ways to onboard as many people as possible. This is why these businesses began to try to modify human interaction for their own benefit: gone was inherently human one-to-one or one-to-few communication in favour of one-to-many: conversations became walls became feeds became suggestions became the "algorithm".

Over time, the massive collectives of bright minds that worked at these businesses found new and exciting ways to maximise engagement by hacking and modifying the monkey parts of their users' brains. Take Twitter, a multi-billion dollar company beloved by a tiny sliver of journalists, celebrities and politicians and fuelled for years on white hot rage and scandal. Or Sean Parker, an early investor in Facebook, who admitted that they were exploiting "a vulnerability in human psychology" so they could make money.

The user interaction we know as "Pull to Refresh" is so ridiculously effective at driving user behaviour that gigantic amounts of cash were spent fighting over its patent in courts. The fact it mimics another money hose in our society - the arms of slot machines in casinos - is no coincidence.

The unit economics of the internet - of broadband and app stores and cloud hosting - made it easier than ever before for these ostensibly human-oriented enterprises to reach these inhuman levels of scale. These are, by any financial measure, among the most wildly successful commercial enterprises in human history. They are the empires of the modern world.

We're all familiar by now of the adage 'if you do not pay for it, you are the product.' An important corollary to this is that a Product is not in control of who it is sold to, or how it is sold. The services were not really free. The price we paid was not with our wallets, but with our minds. They hacked our monkey brains into using their services compulsively and in doing so transformed what human interaction meant for an entire generation.

## The end of the Imperial Age

So these platforms got better and better at manipulating human behaviour towards whatever features generated most value for them and grew, and grew, and grew. When you're playing the Venture Capital game, this phase is generally the point at which the benevolence of the investors runs out and they need a return somehow. Exponential growth became harder or impossible to achieve and money became harder to raise. This meant that instead of optimising for user acquisition it was time to start to optimise for money.

These businesses did not sell anything to its users, but they did hold their attention. So they made money by charging other entities who would be interested in that attention: advertisers, analysts and anyone who would pay to understand and manipulate collective human behaviour. The result was more and more 'user-hostile' things being inserted in to the experience more and more egregiously.

Right now, in 2024, we are firmly in the Late Imperial phase of these social media empires and people are starting to realise just how shitty this success has made the platforms for the actual humans involved. Meta might make billions of dollars a year, but if you've been on Instagram or Facebook you won't feel that the experience is better for all this money. Influencers and advertisers have worked out to how commercialise every aspect of the platform not already commercialised by the Empire running the show. It's foolish to expect these services to get any 'better' in this regard. This is and always was the purpose of these platforms.

In recent years, this has become known as "enshittification". A great name for the effect on the user, but my issue with that term is that it suggests that the service was somehow not already shitty to begin with.

There is [study after study after study](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/research/the-evidence) showing just how damaging to our  monkey brains all this hacking has been. It manifests as a shocking rise in mental health in people of all ages, most of all adolescents and children.

Consider how many friends or followers you have on your social network of choice. Do you think any of your ancestors had anything like that number of associates?

If you think it is normal to routinely hear about and interact with the intimate lives of thousands of strangers or near-strangers: it is not normal.

If you think it is normal to publicise your own life to this many people relentlessly: it is not normal.

We only think it is normal because in the last 15 years this has been the most effective way for a small group of businesses to make money from us.

The services are not being 'enshittified', they were shitty to begin with. The imperial age of these social media platforms is coming to an end. What comes next?

## Islands outside of empires

One of the defining destructive aspects of Web 2.0 social media is its scale. Many of the hacks they've performed on us are only to enable, and then monetise, high growth and widespread adoption. While technology might make these inhuman hyperscale endeavours possible, the beautiful thing about the internet is its open ended-ness. It is entirely possible to operate on the internet at a small scale forever, to reject growth where it doesn't make sense for you.

If you're tired of the big empires on the internet - the giant enshittified social networks - it is possible to stake out a part of the internet for yourself completely outside of them. It is especially important for you to live your social life outside of these corporate behemoths.

Before you begin to think of me as some utopian idealist: I happily make my money by building software (sometimes ads!) commercially. I am not saying we should move completely away from commercial enterprise into a series of communes. It wouldn't work. The internet is a broad church and there is a clear place for commerce. Nobody walks into a shop and complains about the ads. I buy my Gochujang paste on Amazon at a huge mark-up, just like many other middle class westerners, because it is easy.

It's just your social life I am here to pitch for. You do not need to habitually interact intimately with strangers online. Your social interactions do not have to be defined by a gigantic corporate behemoth trying to hack your brain to make money. Our behaviours might have been changed, but they can be changed back.

So, how do we do this? The answer, if not simple, starts with a simple premise: reject corporate social networks and instead go and build your own. Instead of socialising inside a giant empire of strangers, live on an island, with people you actually know.

It is this feature, I hope, that is a defining and exciting aspect of a new internet: an internet of Islands as well as Empires. Nothing has to happen for us to grasp this new model: it's already completely possible. And what's more: it is easier to build now than it ever was before.

Now, at this point I might have lost you. Not everyone has the time to learn how to do this. But each year more and more people, young and old, learn to code using tools vastly more capable than those of the past. Software development is becoming, if not quite a commodity, then more of a generalist skill. Knowledge that used to be the preserve of a very small number of highly trained workers is now available, for free, for everyone. Open Source software is more widespread now than at any time since Ada Lovelace first set eyes on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.

## Building an Island

I'm using this term "Island" to describe a sort of homemade small software that exists in isolation, or with loose connections to other small pieces of software on the internet. Outside the giant Empires of Meta and Reddit and X. These places are self-governing, self-deterministic and entirely free of the need to make money.

Islands are software projects that actually **reject scale** and all its false promises. Fundamentally, the kinds of software I am describing are by definition small forever. The ceiling will be built-in because anything above that ceiling would need a business to run it. I'm talking about the subset of software designed never to make money.

A quick caveat: when I describe Islands I am not talking about BlueSky or Mastodon or any framework that looks just like Twitter or Instagram or TikTok but is supposedly free and open. I am extremely wary of these businesses (and they all are businesses) and what the end state looks like when they have to start making money. Proprietary networks are not the problem. Scale, and the change it breeds in social interaction, is the problem.

Instead of copying the playbook of these Empires, an Island will **reject many Web 2.0 principles** like default one-to-many communication, endless doomscrolling feeds and the rest of the monkey-brain hacker techniques that we only associate with social software because they made for effective money hoses.

These Islands will be pieces of software that can be **used infrequently** in addition to (hopefully!) real life social interaction. You don't need to generate habitual daily active users if you're building an Island.

If you are invested in making an Island, you better be ready for it to be **a labour of love and not money**. This sort of software will not get you rich. you might need to take a day job inside The Empire to learn your skill and earn your rent.

Building an Island is not easy, but it's increasingly not hard either. There are none of the challenges of finding a 'total addressable market' or worrying about choosing tools that will scale when you only want to build for 10 users. You can choose whatever technology you want and it doesn't need to be as polished as the commercial equivalent. It almost certainly won't be and frankly, who fucking cares? Make it work, make it useful, make it beautiful in that order.

In their quest to compete financially, the Empires have created cheap and commoditised tools for building Islands that are unlikely to go anywhere, even if the Empires themselves eventually die away. I'm not advocating that everyone go completely bare metal and run a server from a micro PC in your living room (I do that for fun but it is a pain) because frankly you will almost certainly need to rent the true commodities like DNS and servers. This is fine. Embrace your position. Take the parts of their 'civilisation' that you need to make your own little Island work. Rent servers from AWS if you want. Use tools built by Meta.

You can scale up a perfectly suitable web service of the sort I am describing for no more than about £5 a month (you don't need auto scaling with 10 users) and £20 a year for a domain name (you don't need a premium domain if you don't care who finds you.) The biggest investment is your time. And you might even enjoy that part. Especially when people you love actually starting using it.

Not everyone has to build or live on an Island - and nobody has to live exclusively on one. But I think more and more people will start to build and inhabit them as the Empires start to become shittier places to hang out. Scale is what destroys empires in the end. We are approaching the Dark Ages of the Internet.

## Into the Dark Ages

I've seen this movement play out in my own life: my friends and I have variously build our own little Islands, loosely connected. We've built video streaming sites, image sharing sites, a tabletop RPG server. Unless you know me, you might never see these places.

I'm sure they're a bit janky and less easy-to-use than their mainstream counterparts. But my friends and family use them and that's enough. They borrow, use, and morph parts of commercial and social software. But they are optimised for us rather than for money.

And it can't just be us. I'm convinced that this is going on all over the place and will grow in popularity. You might never really know because that's the point - the folks that build and use these places aren't trying to sell you something. It's already out there if you search for terms like indieweb, smol sites, home-cooked meals, but it's a Dark Age - living there beyond the Recorded History of marketing channels and Ad Spend in the parts of the internet where actual people still live.

Perhaps the most low-tech Islands are group chats, which are becoming more and more popular. But my gut feeling is that enshittification will come for platforms like WhatsApp too, just like it did all the others.

Remember, this does not need to be a bloodthirsty revolution. You don't need to delete all your social media accounts. You are free to use The Products of Empire in your day-to-day life. But think about what having a big corporate entity control the way you interact with people is doing to your brain. Islands offer us a way back, off the ledge, away from poisonous social interactions that only exist because they make money. You simply don't need to hang out with strangers all the time. A lot of what is stopping people leaving the Empire is habit combined with the lack of an alternative.

If you have found yourself grieving over Web 2.0, start staking your place in Web 4.0 (Web 3.0 was taken by that dumb fucking blockchain shit smh.) I guarantee you it is already out here in the dark, away from the glittering cities of the empires. Your monkey brain will thank you.
